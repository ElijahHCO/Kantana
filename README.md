                                Hi üëã, We are Kantata

                                
Kantata is an app for EVERYONE to buy and sell instruments anywhere in the world. Kantata has the right tempo for everyone! We approached this app with the intention of creating something that has not been accomplished. While developing the idea we realized our goal was going to take more time than allotted for this assignment. We ran into challenges creating our roadmap in a short one-week period. Upon our decision to move forward with an application we can be proud of and accomplish the mvp goals of the assignment we focused on building out one main feature of our application and plan to continue working on our bigger goals for Kantata in the the future. With Kantata you can bull and sell instruments from an awesome community of artists and musicians around the world. Our future goals are to integrate a music sharing service and create an environment to promote a virtual jam session platform where you can meet with like minded individuals to create and share music.

Mongoose is our DBs, Sessions to store the user‚Äôs information, Store to keep the cookies, Flash to display messages.


We used Passport for user authentification, specifically the Local Strategy, we had plans to use more strategies like Google or Facebook, passport stores the user into session, the way it works is taking the users input, comparing the credentials, verifying the credentials, and goes into serializing the user storing it into a cookie.

According to the FilePond Documentation: ‚ÄúFilePond is a JavaScript library that brings silky smooth drag n' drop file uploading. These docs they will help install, setup, modify and extend FilePond.‚Äù The way we used it is to upload the files with previews, and then it would create the path so we can use it throughout the app. We take the image and then verify the type, then check if we take that image file we‚Äôre going to pass it to a function and parse the data, and then we take it to our model and store it.

Notes:
We accomplished most of our goals that we started with, but unfortunately had to sideline the music-sharing and music-collaboration sections of the app until after project due date. This was to ensure we had a functioning app Monday for the presentation. 

We would also like to add a profile-picture feature so users can personailze their profile pages in the future.

Google login was and is a feature we hope to add as well

The obvious next step for the app would be implementing a function to actually buy/sell the instruments listed on the site. As of now it is effectivly a newspaper for users to see listings and directly contact the user selling to inquire about actually purchasing.
